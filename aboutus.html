        <h2>About Us</h2>

        <p>
            TicketBlaster began as a simple idea shared by three passionate programmers during a college project.
            That idea grew far beyond the classroom and evolved into one of the 
            fastest growing ticket platforms today.
        </p>

        <p>
       We are three women in tech who bonded over our love of live events and our frustration 
            with how difficult it could be to get reliable tickets. What started as a 
            semester assignment quickly transformed into a working prototype,
            then a full platform, and now a thriving business trusted by fans across the country.
