                <p>
                    Once your purchase is confirmed, tickets are sent directly to the email address associated 
                    with your account. You can also view and download your mobile tickets by logging in and 
                    visiting the "My Tickets" section.

                <summary><strong>Are the tickets on TicketBlaster verified?</strong></summary>
                <p>
                    Yes! We guarantee that every ticket sold on our platform is 100% verified and authentic. 
                    We work directly with event organizers and verified resellers to ensure you get into your event safely.

                <summary><strong>Can I get a refund if I can't attend?</strong></summary>
                <p>
                    All sales are final. However, if an event is cancelled by the organizer, you will receive 
                    an automatic refund to your original payment method within 7-10 business days.

                    Service fees help us cover the costs of operating our secure platform, providing 24/7 customer support, 
                    and verifying ticket authenticity. We strive to keep these fees as low and transparent as possible.
